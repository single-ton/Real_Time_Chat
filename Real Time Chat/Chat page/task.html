<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In the stage, you'll create a chat application by implementing the page that has three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A text field to input messages;</li>
<li>A button that will send an input message;</li>
<li>A message container where messages will appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stage focuses on the page design, use HTML/CSS to implement it.</p>
<p>To finish the project, you may need to search for some information on your own. Revisit topics, refer to documentation, or search for some additional guides and tutorials if you need to.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">When you run tests for the first time, they will install a browser that will be used to test the program. Make sure the IDE, the node, and the browser are not blocked by a firewall; otherwise, tests can fail.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create the <code class="java">static</code> folder in the <code class="java">resources</code> folder. In the <code class="java">static</code> folder, create <em>index.html </em>file. It will be the chat page. It is a good practice to store CSS and JS code separately, you can create two (or more) files to store CSS/JS in the same folder. These additional files can have any name.</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything is correct, after running the program and navigating to <em>http://localhost:28852</em> in a browser, you should see the content of the <em>index.html </em>file.</p>
<ul>
<li>The page should have a <code class="java">title</code> tag with the text <code class="java">Chat</code>.</li>
<li>Add an input field that will be used to input messages. You can use the <code class="java">textarea</code> or <code class="java">input</code> tag. The tag should have an ID of <code class="java">input-msg</code>;</li>
<li>Add a button with the ID of <code class="java">send-msg-btn</code> that will be used to send messages. The button can have any name or contain an image;</li>
<li>Add a tag with the ID of <code class="java">messages</code>. This element will contain all received messages. In this stage, it will contain only hard-coded messages;</li>
<li>The element with the ID of <code class="java">messages</code> should contain five elements with the class <code class="java">message</code>. Each of these inner elements should have some text (a message). For example, <code class="java">&lt;div id="messages"&gt;&lt;div class="message"&gt;Hi&lt;/div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order of mentioned elements is not relevant. Furthermore, it is not mandatory to place the mentioned elements directly in the <code class="java">body</code> tag and there can be some intermediate element(s). The same applies to the message container, which can contain some intermediate elements with elements (messages) with the <code class="java">message</code> class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the CSS styles. The main goal in this stage is to set the size of elements and position them. Tests will not check CSS in this stage.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>the first version of the page could look something like this</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="628" name="image.png" src="https://ucarecdn.com/ae875427-d5d2-4604-a204-d5dd42a2883f/" width="775"/></p>
